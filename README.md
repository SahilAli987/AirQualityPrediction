# Air Quality Index Prediction 🌍

## Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive Air Quality Index (AQI) prediction system that helps users determine air quality based on various pollutant parameters. The application provides both manual input prediction and real-time geolocation-based air quality monitoring.

## 🎯 Features
- **Manual Prediction**: Input pollutant levels manually to predict AQI
- **Geolocation-based Prediction**: Get real-time AQI predictions based on your current location
- **Interactive Visualization**: Explore relationships between different pollutants through charts and graphs
- **Health Recommendations**: Receive health advice based on the predicted AQI level
- **Model Performance Metrics**: View the model's accuracy and reliability

## 🌟 Novelty Features
### 1. Real-time Geolocation Integration
- **Automatic Location Detection**: Uses browser's geolocation API to detect user's current location
- **WAQI API Integration**: Fetches real-time air quality data from the World Air Quality Index Project
- **Dynamic Updates**: Continuously updates AQI predictions based on location changes
- **Global Coverage**: Works with monitoring stations worldwide

### 2. Smart Health Recommendations
- **Contextual Advice**: Provides health recommendations based on:
  - Current AQI level
  - Time of day
  - User location
- **Color-coded Alerts**: Visual indicators for different air quality levels
- **Activity Recommendations**: Suggests outdoor activity modifications
- **Health Risk Indicators**: Shows specific risks for sensitive groups

### 3. Advanced Visualization System
- **Interactive Charts**: Dynamic visualization of pollutant relationships
- **Trend Analysis**: Historical AQI data visualization
- **Pollutant Comparison**: Side-by-side comparison of different pollutants
- **Geospatial Visualization**: Map-based representation of AQI levels

### 4. Hybrid Prediction System
- **Multi-model Approach**: Combines multiple ML models for better accuracy
- **Real-time Validation**: Cross-validates predictions with actual sensor data
- **Confidence Metrics**: Displays prediction confidence levels
- **Adaptive Learning**: Improves predictions based on historical accuracy

### 5. User Experience Enhancements
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly across devices
- **Intuitive Interface**: Easy-to-understand pollution metrics
- **Quick Share**: Share AQI reports via social media or email
- **Customizable Alerts**: Set personal AQI thresholds for notifications

## 🔍 Key Parameters
The system considers the following pollutants for AQI prediction:
- PM2.5 (Fine particulate matter)
- NO2 (Nitrogen Dioxide)
- SO2 (Sulfur Dioxide)
- CO (Carbon Monoxide)
- O3 (Ozone)
